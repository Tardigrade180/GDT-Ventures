### StoreKeeper PWA – Modern shop inventory app with price management, delivery requests, and Paystack-ready payments.


1. It should be installable as a PWA (meaning it can be installed on a phone as an app).

2. The goal will be to list products in a shop with actual and discounted prices.

3. ⁠There should be an admin portal where the owner can update the product prices. 

4. ⁠The listed items should have an option to order for delivery 🚚 that goes to a page to input their details and request a delivery. In the future we would add a payment option with Paystack. If it’s easy and quick to add the payment option now, let’s add it.

5. ⁠The UI should be modern and responsive.
